                <p id="txt">Bob Marley, in full Robert Nesta Marley, (born February 6, 1945, Nine Miles, St. Ann,
                    Jamaica—died
                    May 11, 1981, Miami, Florida, U.S.), Jamaican singer-songwriter whose thoughtful ongoing
                    distillation of early ska, rock steady, and reggae musical forms blossomed in the 1970s into an
                    electrifying rock-influenced hybrid that made him an international superstar.</p>
                <p id="txt">Marley—whose parents were Norval Sinclair Marley, a white rural overseer, and the former
                    Cedella
                    Malcolm, the black daughter of a local custos (respected backwoods squire)—would forever remain
                    the
                    unique product of parallel worlds. His poetic worldview was shaped by the countryside, his music
                    by
                    the tough West Kingston ghetto streets. Marley’s maternal grandfather was not just a prosperous
                    farmer but also a bush doctor adept at the mysticism-steeped herbal healing that guaranteed
                    respect
                    in Jamaica’s remote hill country. As a child Marley was known for his shy aloofness, his
                    startling
                    stare, and his penchant for palm reading. Virtually kidnapped by his absentee father (who had
                    been
                    disinherited by his own prominent family for marrying a black woman), the preadolescent Marley
                    was
                    taken to live with an elderly woman in Kingston until a family friend rediscovered the boy by
                    chance
                    and returned him to Nine Miles.</p>
